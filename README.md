## 🚀 Overview
An engineering-focused tool designed to optimize arterial traffic signal coordination using **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**. 

### Core Problem
Arterial traffic congestion is often caused by poorly coordinated signal timings. Existing industry tools are either prohibitively expensive or lack intuitive visualization for engineers to perform "what-if" analysis in real-time.

### The Solution
I built a full-stack workstation that:
1.  **Optimizes:** Uses the **Gurobi Optimizer** to maximize "Green Bandwidth" along a corridor using the MAXBAND mathematical model.
2.  **Visualizes:** Renders an interactive **Time-Space Diagram** using a custom SVG engine, making complex data easy to interpret.
3.  **Adjusts:** Allows for manual fine-tuning through drag-and-drop interactions, giving engineers total control.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** React.js, Mapbox GL JS, SVG/D3.js logic.
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask), Gurobi Optimizer, Pandas/NumPy.
*   **Methodology:** Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP).

## 🏆 Achievements & Recognition
*   **Performance:** Achieved optimization results that reach parity with industry-standard software (Waysync).
*   **Competitions:** Presented and showcased at **INotek**, receiving positive feedback on the UI/UX and solver efficiency.
*   **Innovation:** Successfully developed a web-based implementation of the MAXBAND algorithm, traditionally reserved for heavy desktop-only applications.
